# Crisp for WHMCS
This addon installs the Crisp chatbox on your WHMCS client area. The plugin automatically sets the users name and e-mail address upon login and has an option to hide the chatbox for admins to avoid user impersonation.

### Extra functionality using the WHMCS PRO plugin
The Crisp WHMCS addon also communicates with the *optional* Crisp WHMCS PRO plugin on your Crisp website.
With this plugin enabled, the addon can sync client data directly to your Crisp Contacts, allowing you to - for example - use them in Crisp Campaigns, or to have shortcuts to your WHMCS installation available in Crisp for quick support.
The WHMCS addon also implements all functionality such as [Identity Verification](https://docs.crisp.chat/guides/chatbox-sdks/web-sdk/identity-verification/) and [Session Continuity](https://docs.crisp.chat/guides/chatbox-sdks/web-sdk/session-continuity/) with configuration options in the Addon Settings.

To install the plugin to your Crisp website, click [here](https://app.crisp.chat/initiate/plugin/43613682-40a4-43aa-85a7-3013dbe5f0ad/).

***This addon also works without the installation of the WHMCS PRO plugin in Crisp. The WHMCS PRO plugin in Crisp is completely optional.***
